# Ops201d2-Challenges

  This repo is the collection of my assignments from Code Fellows Ops 201 course. Throughout the course these assignments helped me learn the basics of bash and powershell scripting. In 201 I learneda lot of core concepts such as how to use virtual box and the basics of the aformentioned languages.
