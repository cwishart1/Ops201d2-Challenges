# Ops201d2-Challenges

  This repo is the collection of my assignments from Code Fellows Ops 201 course. Throughout the course these assignments helped me learn the basics of bash and powershell scripting. In 201 I learned a lot of core concepts such as how to use virtual box and the basics of the aformentioned languages. My favorite was challenge5.sh, I completed the assignment early and experimented with a basic ui system I could expand upon later adding new functions and perhaps make it a bash toolkit of sorts with many useful functions that can be repeated if necessary. With IT jobs moving further and further into automation knowing how to script in these languages is invaluable and would save you so much time automating many of the monotonous tasks you would do on a regular basis such as deploying system OS. I would like to improve my overall knowledge of these languages so I can code more complex scripts with ease.
